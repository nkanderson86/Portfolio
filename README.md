## Technology Used 
- BootStrap 
- animate.css
- jQuery 

I brought in bootstrap for the contact modal and animate.css for some of the animations.  I challenged myself to the use the CSS grid system in leui of just using bootstraps built in positioning.  I use jQuery to build the cards for each of my projects and for hiding and showing content depending on which button the user has clicked in the nav bar. 

## Wins 
I really like building the cards dynamically.  It's set up nicely to just add and remove projects as needed from my array and the cards automatically adjust since they are built on each page load.
