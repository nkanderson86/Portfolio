## Hurdles 
The hardest part of this assignment for me was choosing a theme and going for it.  I spent wayyy too much time playig with photo editors and color schemes and not enough time polishing up the animations and layouts of each section of the page.  I plan to give this page a lot more love this week and get it to a point where I am proud to show it to potential employers so I can start applying for jobs. 

## Wins 
I really like building the cards dynamically.  I am very comfortable with the code behind it now and will use it any time I can.
